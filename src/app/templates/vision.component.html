                <p>The goal of these transformations is decarbonization: using less carbonized energy and incorporating more renewable energy. These transformations fundamentally change the way energy is generated, distributed and consumed from the traditional, one-way centralized model to a new, two-way decentralized model.</p>

                <p>It becomes clear that the global warming is one of the biggest threats to the world we live in and the carbon content in our atmosphere is the culprit. At GridX, it is our belief that the key to reducing carbon emission is through energy product, pricing and business model transformations. And the linchpin to such transformations is a financial operating system that aligns the economic interests of all participants in energy production, distribution and consumption value chain to achieve the common goal. We are proud to use our experience, expertise and ingenuity to help reshape our future and create the world we want for our and the future generations. We invite you to join us in such an endeavor (Cross-linked to Contact).</p>
