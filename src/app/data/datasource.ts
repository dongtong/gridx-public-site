  "challenge": "Clean-air mandates and widespread adoption of distributed generation drive utilities worldwide to reform their products, tariffs and business models. However, these new products and decentralized business models are substantially more complex to develop, operationalize, market and analyze. Traditional analytical and operational tools are not equipped to utilize all of the large volume of the smart meter data to perform analyses effectively and bill for new products efficiently.",
  "solution": "GridX provides a suite of applications to enable utilities to operate the new decentralized business models. These applications enable utilities to develop better products, tariffs and business models, effectively promote them and efficiently support the meter-to-cash operations"
},{
  "title": "Energy Services Providers",
  "icon": "src/app/stylesheets/images/solutions/service-provider-icon.png",
  "challenge": "Energy services providers (ESPs), which offer a wide variety energy related services to utility customers, need financial quality analytics to develop products and pricing terms to optimize services for their customers. Traditionally, ESPs have had to develop such capabilities internally through ad hoc tools and processes to model and manage a large number of tariffs and perform financial analyses to support the product and pricing development.",
  "solution": "GridX offers a suite of cloud based revenue grade tariff models and tariff management capabilities to streamline the tariff modeling and management processes at a fraction of the time and cost related to legacy tools."
},{
  "title": "Retail Energy Suppliers",
  "icon": "src/app/stylesheets/images/solutions/retail-energy-supplier-icon.png",
  "challenge": "One of the key challenges for retail energy suppliers is to develop products and pricing plans that optimize margins. Traditional billing and risk management systems focus on either revenues or commodity costs. Neither provides a single view of profitability.",
  "solution": "GridX offers a suite of applications to allow retail energy providers to develop services and pricing plans that optimize revenues and profitability.  In addition, the applications monitor financial performance and proactively manage risk."
},{
  "title": "Energy Prosumers",
  "icon": "src/app/stylesheets/images/solutions/prosumer-icon.png",
  "challenge": "With the emergence of new energy technologies such as distributed generation and demand response, traditional utility customers are being transformed from passive energy consumers to energy “prosumers”. This new class of participants in the new energy economies is being confronted with increasingly more complex energy related decisions. To deal with the complexities, customers need accurate pricing models and analytical tools to help them understand the financial implications of these decisions.",
  "solution": "Traditionally, these decisions were made through ad hoc tools, back of the envelope estimation or simply calling utilities’ customer support."
